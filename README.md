# Java Academy (Junior - Middle)

Version: **1.12**

<i>JAcademy</i> is the project that teaches to program in the java language and to think as an engineer.
Each topic has small explanation of a problem or an idea and the solution, you can use it as you wish and as you want.

As a start point, let's address to:

[Programming Principles](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-algorithms/ "Programming Principles"),
[Software Architecture Cheat Sheet](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-algorithms/ "Software Architecture Cheat Sheet");

## [Algorithms](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-algorithms/ "The algorithms chapter")

As a start point, let's address to:

[Big-O Notation](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-algorithms/ "Big-O Notation").

In this module the following algorithms will be described:

* Sort Algorithms:
  [Bubble Sort](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-algorithms/ "The bubble sort chapter"),
  [Selection Sort](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-algorithms/ "The selection sort chapter"),
  [Insertion Sort](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-algorithms/ "The insertion sort chapter"),
  [Shell Sort](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-algorithms/ "The shell sort chapter"),
  [Merge Sort](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-algorithms/ "The merge sort chapter"),
  [Quick Sort](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-algorithms/ "The quick sort chapter"),
  [Counting Sort](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-algorithms/ "The counting sort chapter"),
  [Radix Sort](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-algorithms/ "The radix sort chapter"),
  [Bucket Sort](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-algorithms/ "The bucket sort chapter").
* Search Algorithms:
  [Linear Search](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-algorithms/ "The linear search chapter"),
  [Binary Search](https://it-skills-exchange.github.io/jacademy-algorithms/ "The binary search chapter").
